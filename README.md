# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

- [x] Initialize a create-react-app
- [x] import libraries for color (probably kuler, randomcolor) from npm
- [x] figure out how to generate random colors in the console with the hex code
- [x] figure out how to generate colors on the website
- [x] Maybe change the color of the text so that you can always read it (e.g. white)
- [x] figure out how to generate random colors on the website
- [x] figure out how to create a button with the text 'Generate'
- [x] figure out how to change state when clicking the button
  - [x] Create a state
  - [x] Display the current state
  - [x] Connect the onchange event to update the state
- [x] figure out how to show a random color when the button is clicked
- [x] figure out how to connect this random color to the background color of a div
- [x] figure out how to generate the hex code that matches the generated color
- [x] the div must contain the exact text Generated Color: <background color hex code>
